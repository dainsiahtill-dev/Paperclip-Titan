# AGENTS.md

Guidance for human and AI contributors working in this repository.

## 1. Purpose

Paperclip is a control plane for AI-agent companies.
The current implementation target is V1 and is defined in `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`.

## 2. Read This First

Before making changes, read in this order:

1. `doc/GOAL.md`
2. `doc/PRODUCT.md`
3. `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`
4. `doc/DEVELOPING.md`
5. `doc/DATABASE.md`

`doc/SPEC.md` is long-horizon product context.
`doc/SPEC-implementation.md` is the concrete V1 build contract.

When adding or changing an Apps catalog connection, also follow
`doc/connections/CONNECTOR-PLAYBOOK.md`. It is the canonical connection
authoring runbook for provider research, supported transport/auth patterns,
credential handling, branding, implementation, testing, live proof, and PR
submission.

## 3. Repo Map

- `server/`: Express REST API and orchestration services
- `ui/`: React + Vite board UI
- `packages/db/`: Drizzle schema, migrations, DB clients
- `packages/shared/`: shared types, constants, validators, API path constants
- `packages/adapters/`: agent adapter implementations (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.)
- `packages/adapter-utils/`: shared adapter utilities
- `packages/plugins/`: plugin system packages
- `packages/skills-catalog/`: app-shipped skills catalog (`@paperclipai/skills-catalog`)
- `packages/teams-catalog/`: app-shipped teams catalog (`@paperclipai/teams-catalog`)
- `cli/`: `paperclipai` CLI package (published bin, agent-facing commands)
- `skills/`: Paperclip runtime/operational skills (not part of the app catalog)
- `doc/`: operational and product docs

## 4. Dev Setup (Auto DB)

Use embedded PGlite in dev by leaving `DATABASE_URL` unset.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- API: `http://localhost:3100`
- UI: `http://localhost:3100` (served by API server in dev middleware mode)

Quick checks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health
curl http://localhost:3100/api/companies
```

Reset local dev DB:

```sh
rm -rf data/pglite
pnpm dev
```

## 5. Core Engineering Rules

1. Keep changes company-scoped.
Every domain entity should be scoped to a company and company boundaries must be enforced in routes/services.

Explicit exception: announcement dismissals are instance-wide user preferences,
keyed by user and announcement so they persist across companies. Their audit
context must still validate company membership. The announcement publication-ID
registry is instance-level feed metadata; it contains no company or user data.

2. Keep contracts synchronized.
If you change schema/API behavior, update all impacted layers:
- `packages/db` schema and exports
- `packages/shared` types/constants/validators
- `server` routes/services
- `ui` API clients and pages

3. Preserve control-plane invariants.
- Single-assignee task model
- Atomic issue checkout semantics
- Approval gates for governed actions
- Budget hard-stop auto-pause behavior
- Activity logging for mutating actions

4. Do not replace strategic docs wholesale unless asked.
Prefer additive updates. Keep `doc/SPEC.md` and `doc/SPEC-implementation.md` aligned.

5. Keep repo plan docs dated and centralized.
When you are creating a plan file in the repository itself, new plan documents belong in `doc/plans/` and should use `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` filenames. This does not replace Paperclip issue planning: if a Paperclip issue asks for a plan, update the issue `plan` document per the `paperclip` skill instead of creating a repo markdown file.

6. Attach inspectable generated artifacts.
When your task produces a user-inspectable deliverable file, follow the Paperclip skill's "Generated Artifacts and Work Products" workflow before final disposition. In this repo, prefer the self-contained skill helper at `skills/paperclip/scripts/paperclip-upload-artifact.sh` so the file is available through the Paperclip API, create/update an artifact work product when the file is the deliverable, link the uploaded artifact in the final issue comment, and then set status. Do not rely on local filesystem paths as the only access path. If an important file intentionally remains workspace-only, create/update a work product with `metadata.resourceRef.kind: "workspace_file"` and a workspace-relative path, then name that work product and path in the final comment. Treat browse/search as a fallback for recovering workspace files, not the preferred deliverable path. See `doc/AGENT-ARTIFACTS.md` for details and `.mp4`/`.webm` examples.

7. Name the three data paths correctly.
This repo has three separate data paths. Do not confuse them. Match a change to a path by its file path, not by the word "observability" or "telemetry" alone.

- **Telemetry** is the Paperclip first-party event system. It is opt-out and it sends data to a Paperclip endpoint by default. Its paths are:
  - `packages/shared/src/telemetry/`
  - the generated contract `packages/shared/src/telemetry/generated/paperclip-telemetry.ts`
  - each caller of `packages/shared/src/telemetry/events.ts` or `packages/shared/src/telemetry/client.ts`
- **Observability** is the OpenTelemetry trace path. An operator must set an OTLP endpoint. Until an operator sets the endpoint, the tracer is a no-operation. Its paths are:
  - `server/src/instrumentation.ts`
  - `doc/observability.md`
  - `packages/adapter-utils/src/duplex-observability.ts`
  - `server/src/services/duplex-observability-recorder.ts`
  - the span attributes in `packages/adapter-utils/src/acpx-engine/startup-timing.ts`
- **The run log** holds rows in the local `heartbeat_run_events` table. The data stays in the instance database. Its paths are:
  - `doc/run-log-events.md`
  - `packages/db/src/schema/heartbeat_run_events.ts`
  - the append path `appendRunEvent` in `server/src/services/heartbeat.ts`

Apply a review level that matches the path:

- **Telemetry change (strict review).** The author updates the generated contract first. The author updates `packages/shared/src/telemetry/README.md` in the same pull request. The author requests a privacy review. Reason: a Telemetry event goes to a Paperclip endpoint by default, so a mistake sends data immediately.
- **Observability change (lighter review).** The operator endpoint gate stays in place. The no-operation behaviour stays when no endpoint is set. A privacy review is not necessary while the change stays inside the closed span-attribute allowlist.
- **Run-log change (no extra review).** A run-log change needs neither review level above, because the data stays in the instance database.

**Exclusion.** The word "observability" in a file such as `server/src/services/recovery-observability.ts` names a different concept. Apply this rule by path, not by word match.

## 6. Database Change Workflow

When changing data model:

1. Edit `packages/db/src/schema/*.ts`
2. Ensure new tables are exported from `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts`
3. Generate migration:

```sh
pnpm db:generate
```

4. Validate compile:

```sh
pnpm -r typecheck
```

Notes:
- `packages/db/drizzle.config.ts` reads compiled schema from `dist/schema/*.js`
- `pnpm db:generate` compiles `packages/db` first

## 7. Verification Before Hand-off

Default local/agent test path:

```sh
pnpm test
```

This is the cheap default and only runs the Vitest suite. Browser suites stay opt-in:

```sh
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:release-smoke
```

Run the browser suites only when your change touches them or when you are explicitly verifying CI/release flows.

For normal issue work, run the smallest relevant verification first. Do not default to repo-wide typecheck/build/test on every heartbeat when a narrower check is enough to prove the change.

Run this full check before claiming repo work done in a PR-ready hand-off, or when the change scope is broad enough that targeted checks are not sufficient:

```sh
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
pnpm build
```

If anything cannot be run, explicitly report what was not run and why.

## 8. API and Auth Expectations

- Base path: `/api`
- Board access is treated as full-control operator context
- Agent access uses bearer API keys (`agent_api_keys`), hashed at rest
- Agent keys must not access other companies

When adding endpoints:

- apply company access checks
- enforce actor permissions (board vs agent)
- write activity log entries for mutations
- return consistent HTTP errors (`400/401/403/404/409/422/500`)

## 9. UI Expectations

- Keep routes and nav aligned with available API surface
- Use company selection context for company-scoped pages
- Surface failures clearly; do not silently ignore API errors

## 10. Pull Request Requirements

When creating a pull request (via `gh pr create` or any other method), you **must** read and fill in every section of [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Do not craft ad-hoc PR bodies — use the template as the structure for your PR description. Required sections:

- **Thinking Path** — trace reasoning from project context to this change (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for examples)
- **What Changed** — bullet list of concrete changes
- **Verification** — how a reviewer can confirm it works
- **Risks** — what could go wrong
- **Model Used** — the AI model that produced or assisted with the change (provider, exact model ID, context window, capabilities). Write "None — human-authored" if no AI was used.
- **Checklist** — all items checked

## 11. Definition of Done

A change is done when all are true:

1. Behavior matches `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`
2. Typecheck, tests, and build pass
3. Contracts are synced across db/shared/server/ui
4. Docs updated when behavior or commands change
5. PR description follows the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) with all sections filled in (including Model Used)

## Design system

`DESIGN.md` at the repo root is the source of truth for UI design decisions. The token-only rule applies to all `ui/` changes: every color, spacing, radius, type, shadow, and motion value in `ui/src/components/**` and `ui/src/pages/**` comes from the token layer in `ui/src/index.css` — no hex, raw px, arbitrary Tailwind bracket values, or raw `font-size`/`fontSize` declarations in components, outside the documented allowlist in `ui/src/index.css`. Run `pnpm check:token-gates` (`scripts/check-token-gates.mjs`) before committing UI changes — it fails on any violation not covered by that allowlist.

## Project library

Read `project-library/README.md` before searching old task history or reusable resources. Keep searched and generated reusable originals in persistent local project storage with provenance, prompt, version, and status metadata. Register existing runtime paths instead of moving or duplicating them. Prefer summaries, manifests, hashes, thumbnails, and a few necessary originals over loading full conversations or large binary collections.

## Local v3 foundation instructions (2026-09-27)

The following v3 startup and ordinary-directory notes describe the macOS checkout named below. They do not select ports, instances, providers, or workspace layout for a different host. For the WSL maintenance checkout at `/home/dains/Documents/paperclip`, preserve the default3100 instance and do not import or resume the macOS instance's data. The user's 2026-10-07 workflow supersedes the earlier maintenance-worktree guidance: make changes directly on `main`, validate, commit the code, then update the local Paperclip service. Do not create new branches, worktrees, or code copies for maintenance. Isolated test state, temporary files and execution processes remain allowed. Preserve unrelated edits and existing worktree contents; do not delete old directories implicitly.

- User project name: 项目管理后台 v3. This independent clone is based on Paperclip v2026.916.1; preserve upstream source and MIT attribution.
- Read `README.V3.md` and `project-library/README.md` first for local handoff and actual execution status.
- Keep the old 项目管理后台 and its data, services, agents, artwork, and configs separate. Do not migrate them or resume legacy tasks implicitly.
- Use project-local `.paperclip/`, instance `project-management-v3`, and loopback port 3133 after checking availability. Do not inherit an external database URL or use global Paperclip state. These are startup requirements, not verified runtime claims.
- Initial bootstrap must remain an empty instance: no company/agent/task creation, no model calls or credential import, no onboarding CEO or automatic service installation.
- Routine implementation stays with the user-authorized Hermes route; do not change model/provider or use paid fallback. Single writer per checkout. Do not restart or duplicate unknown submissions.
- Historical V2 install task remains paused without a session binding. The user subsequently requested direct Paperclip startup; Codex completed installation and local browser/API verification. Do not resume that superseded install request. See README.V3.md for current runtime status.
- Do not delete existing files without user consent. Keep plans in `doc/plans/`; register source and handoff in this single `project-library/`.

- 2026-09-27 startup scope: the user explicitly requested running Paperclip directly using its own integration capabilities. This startup is complete; Hermes integration/model login are a separate next step. Preserve company data entered through the UI and do not reset the instance.

## Ordinary local project directory (2026-10-01)

- User requires every project directly under `/Volumes/固态硬盘/02_代码项目/<项目名>`; create a missing directory there. Do not create or run projects in `.worktrees`.
- This project is the ordinary checkout `/Volumes/固态硬盘/02_代码项目/项目管理后台v3`.
- Use `scripts/v3-local.sh` or `scripts/titan-local.sh` start|status|stop. Both use this project root and its canonical `.paperclip` and `project-library`.
- Keep instance `project-management-v3`, loopback API 3133 and PostgreSQL 54333, employee credentials/models and disabled scheduler. Existing data is authoritative; do not bootstrap or reset it.
- The pixel-office and NPC work was saved and paused for integration; preserve its unfinished status until user authorizes continued implementation.
